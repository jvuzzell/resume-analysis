I am looking to create a job listing for full stack php developer. 

My company is building a SaaS platform for IT Compliance. Our Software stack is a mixture of: 
- A headless API framework built on Laravel. The APIs support internal functionality as well as third-party integrations with vendors.
- We also leverage Laravel to manage asynchronous jobs and batched processes in the background. 
- We use MySQL to store relational records about transactions and product definition. 
- Our focus is largely on automating processes for internal consultant via data imports from excel to MySQL as well as report generation. 
- We are working on a Version 2 user experience that modernizes our late 90s user experience using react, typescript, and sass. 
- In version 2 we will focus on API documentation, design systems, and developing repeatable development processes. 

Our original Job listing: 
1.    Full-Stack Engineer (strong PHP dev skills are important as the app is written in PHP).
2.    Other technologies in production currently include JavaScript, AWS, HTML/CSS, ORMS, SQL, jQuery, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Open-Source RDBMS, and Docker. 
3.    Strong technical skills with ambition and desire to take on more responsibility in a small firm. 
4.    100% remote position – anywhere from 20-hours/week to full-time, depending on resource & fit – they do not want to disqualify a solid candidate if they can only commit to 20 hours/week
5.    Bachelor’s Degree or equivalent work experience (a degree is not a requirement for the right person).
6.    Experience with Agile Best Practices (currently using Atlassian internally.)
7.    5+ years of experience in software engineering highly preferred
8.    2+ years of experience as a full stack engineer highly preferred
9.    Authorized to work in the United States required 
10.   PHP experience is one of the most important things for this role. Need someone who is full on PHP – developing – not just using it as a tool behind WordPress  
11.   Need boots on the ground to help with the code; they’re on the 5-yard line, but need someone who can get in, roll their sleeves up and work
12.   Need a self-starter; self-motivated individual who can work independently and in small teams  
13.   They use JIRA for their ticketing system / Bitbucket for their depository 
14.   They are on EST hours but open to candidates in any time zone
15.   Ideally US Citizens; they don’t have a requirement for their data, but some of their clients do. Although they don’t access their data, if they can avoid this so they don’t have to worry about this down the road, that would be ideal. 
16.   Must be able to participate in daily scrum meetings
